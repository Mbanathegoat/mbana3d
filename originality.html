        <h2>Statement of Originality</h2>
        <p>
            These web pages are submitted as part requirement for the degree of Advanced Computer Science Ms.C at the University of Sussex. 
            They are the product of my own labour except where indicated in the web page content. These web pages or contents may be freely copied and distributed provided the source is acknowledged.

            Note that the production of this assignment is meant to be your own work. That is, the main concepts and ideas are yours, which you have encapsulated and coded into your assignment as a 3D App. 
            Thus, if you acknowledge other students, etc., as contributors to this assignment, you should state the extent to which they have contributed, which may then lead your assignment being assessed as not wholly your own work and you will be marked appropriately.
